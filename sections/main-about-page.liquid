        <!-- Brand Story -->
        <div class="about-page__brand-story">
          <p><span class="script-initial">We</span> are in the midst of a renaissance in western wear. Pearl snaps and cowboy boots, once rarely seen outside the cattle ranch, have become a minor staple in modern menswear. (Clearly somebody done left the gate open.)</p>

          <p><span class="script-initial">Yet</span> as America once again dreams of the Wild West, popular brands just peddle a neutered take on country fashion, devoid of spirit and divorced from tradition. They've taken a colorful history and painted it corporate gray.</p>

          <p><span class="script-initial">At</span> Lefty's, we draw from the past to design clothes for the present. We start with the best materials we can find, such as 180GSM 100% cotton. Then we build bold, tasteful pearl snap shirts that look as good as they feel.</p>

        <!-- Collection Section -->
        <h3 class="about-page__section-heading">OUR INAUGURAL COLLECTION (WINTER 2025/26)</h3>
        <div class="about-page__collection-text">
          <p>We're excited to premiere two product lines:</p>

          <p>First, we have the OG Fishing Shirt. It has everything you expect from a modern fishing shirt—a zippered phone pocket, built-in lens cloth, and UV protection. Western details like a yoke and pearl snaps complete the look. There's also a secret pocket on the inside for storing your "good bait." The mint green short-sleeved fishing shirt will be available soon for pre-order, with more colors coming within the next few months.</p>

          <p>Second, we have our long-sleeve pearl snap in ultra-durable 180GSM 100% cotton. Inspired by western shirts from the 80's and 90's, these shirts look best tucked into Wranglers. Pre-order <a href="/products/the-duckpopper" class="product-link">The Duckpopper</a> now; more styles coming before the end of winter.</p>
